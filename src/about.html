			<p>The localization of traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions directly correlates with motor disabilities and cognitive impairment. By unfolding magnetic resonance (MR) images of a lesioned rat cortex on a two-dimensional (2D) cytoarchitecture map of the cortex, it is possible to predict the severity of the resulting cognitive and behavioral impairment.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">CortexMap is a web application to estimate the location of the lesion on mouse cerebral cortex caused by TBI induced by lateral fluid-percussion injury. The application unfolds user-determined TBI lesion measurements, e.g., from histologic sections to a reference template, and estimates the total lesion area, including the percentage of cortex damaged in different cytoarchitectural cortical regions.</p> 
			<p class="text-justify">The map of mouse cerebral cortex is based on the mouse brain atlas by Franklin and Paxinos (Franklin KBJ, Paxinos G. 2007. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, 3. ed. Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam [u.a.]). The application is published under MIT licence.</p>
