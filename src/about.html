			<p class="text-justify">CortexMap is a web application to estimate the location of the lesion on mouse cerebral cortex caused by TBI induced by lateral fluid-percussion injury. The application unfolds user-determined TBI lesion measurements, e.g., from histologic sections to a reference template, and estimates the total lesion area, including the percentage of cortex damaged in different cytoarchitectural cortical regions.</p>
